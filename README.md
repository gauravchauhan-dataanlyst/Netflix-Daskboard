This project is a Netflix Dashboard UI built using HTML, designed to replicate the basic layout of the Netflix homepage. 
The purpose of this project is to practice front-end development fundamentals by creating a real-world inspired dashboard structure.
The dashboard includes a navigation bar, banner section, and categorized content areas that represent movie and series listings. The project focuses on proper use of semantic HTML elements, clean page structure, and organized layout design.
